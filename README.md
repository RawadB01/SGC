# SGC
This repository contains the data set and python code we used for simulations on our paper titled "Stochastic Gradient Coding for  Straggler Mitigation in Distributed Learning"

The code is given in "SGC.py" and can be run as a standalone

The data set X saved as "X1-sig100-noisevar=1,noisemean=0,datapoints=1000,dim=100.csv" is a matrix of dimension 1000 times 100 saved in a CSV format

The labels vector Y saved as "Y1-sig100-noisevar=1,noisemean=0,datapoints=1000,dim=100.csv" is a column vector of size 1000 saved in a CSV format. 

The value in row i of Y is a label for the row vector i in X.
